## Summary

A learning-based method for global localization in a known map with unknown initialization (kidnapped robot). Developed a Multi-Input, Multi-Output neural-network architecture that takes as inputs LiDAR measurements and an environment occupancy grip map and outputs a belief of the robots position over that map. Implemented using the Tensorflow/Keras framework on Python.
