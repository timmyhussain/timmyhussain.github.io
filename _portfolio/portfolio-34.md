This project leverages sensors onboard the PSoC 6 Microcontroller to develop an interactive controller for use with the FlightGear 3D flight simulator. The project makes use of
-I2C communication for accessing sensor data
-Multiple threads in C for reading from and writing to shared variables
-UDP communication for reading from and writing to FlightGear
