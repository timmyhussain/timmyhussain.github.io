## Summary

Project centered around working with embedded systems and uses the Cypress Programmable System on Chip (PSoC) 6 Microcontroller to control the three different robot arms. Software is written in entirely in C and enables two different functionalities: linear translation (forward and backward motion) and z-axis rotation (turning left and right). These functionalities are engaged with different keyboard keys as inputs and the number of robot arms used for each of the two functions varies.
