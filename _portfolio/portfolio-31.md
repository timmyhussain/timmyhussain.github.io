A Linear Program formulation and approach to the drone routing problem between multiple points of origin and multiple destinations subject to power constraints. Solved using off-the-shelf optimization solver CVXPY.

Very fun project, made effort to include a lot of real-world considerations and coded in a pretty modular way. Will update further soon.
